1. When a Spring Boot application starts, a login page will be displayed when you access a this URL.

URL :
http://localhost:2023/oauth/authorize?
  response_type=code
  &client_id=ram2910
  &redirect_uri=http://localhost:2023/oauth/login
  &scope=user_info
  
2. You need to fill in the login details on the page. ( balram/balram1998 for USER & admin/balram1998 for ADMIN)
3. After successful login, an approve/deny page will appear.
4. On this page, you will receive a code. This code is then used to make a request to the `http://localhost:2023/oauth/token` endpoint internally.
5. After clicking on "approve" on the approve/deny page, an authorization token will be generated.
6. The authorization token will be in JSON format and will contain an access token and other relevant details.
7. You need to copy the access token from the JSON response.
8. Paste the access token as a bearer token in the API call endpoint.("http://localhost:2023/employees/getAll") in postman.
9. If the API call is made with the correct details and the valid access token, the desired information will be displayed.
10. However, if the access token is missing, incorrect, or expired, a "403 Forbidden" error will be returned, denying access to the requested information.
